# Summary 

## Domain Modeling

*Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.*

**Define a constructor and initialize properties**

*To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function*

**Generate random numbers**

*To model the random nature of user behavior, you'll need the help of a random number generator. Fortunately, the JavaScript standard library includes a Math.random() function for just this sort of occasion.*

**Calculate daily Likes**

*popularity of a video is measured in Likes. And the formula for calculating Likes is the number of viewers times the percentage of viewers who'll Like a video. In other words, viewers times percentage.*

## Defining an HTML Table

An HTML table is defined with
- the <table> tag.
- Each table row is defined with the <tr> tag.
- A table header is defined with the <th> tag.
- By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the <td> tag.

**JavaScript Object Methods**
*In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.*

**JavaScript Methods**

*JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.*
