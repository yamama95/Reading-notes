**How to start in HTML and web design**
*HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the primary building block of creating a website.HTML is a very basic markup language and requires memorization of a few dozen HTML commands that structure the look and layout of a web page*

**some considerations to think about when designing your web page.**
1. How are you going to store all the files? Are all the files going to be in the same folder or directory? If you plan on having lots of different pictures and files, it's recommended that you store the pages, files, and pictures in separate directories.
2. Are the HTML files going to be stored as .HTM or .HTML files? There is no advantage or disadvantage of going with .htm or .html. However, it is a good idea to stick with the same extension.
3. Do you plan on having a template for the pages? Are all the pages going to have the same overall look and feel?
