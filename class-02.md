# HTML book

## HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
## They also provide semantic information (e.g. whereemphasis should be placed, the deÔ¨Ånition of anyacronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

**introducing CSS**
1. The browser loads the HTML
2. The first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that we have some CSS rules we want it to use.
3.  Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS file.
4. To link styles.css to index.html add the following line somewhere inside the <head> of the HTML document.
ex: <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">.
5. Styling HTML elements for examples:
- color text
- color background
- mirgin,padding,border etc
