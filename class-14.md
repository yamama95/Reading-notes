**Transforms**
*With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.*

**Transform Syntax**
*The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.*

**Combining Transforms**

*It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.*

**Perspective Depth Value**
- The perspective value can be set as none or a length measurement. The none value turns off any perspective, while the length value will set the depth of the perspective.

**3D Transforms**
- 3D Rotate
- 3D Scale
- 3D Translate
- 3D Skew

## Transitions & Animations

*One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.*

- Transitions
*As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.*

**Shorthand Transitions**
*Declaring every transition property individually can become quite intensive, especially with vendor prefixes.*

## 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS

1. Fade in :Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients.
2. Change color :Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex.
3. Grow & Shrink:To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding.
4. Rotate elements:CSS transforms have a number of different uses.
5. Square to circle:A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one.
6. 3D shadow:which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.
7. Swing:We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.
8. Inset border:One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border.
