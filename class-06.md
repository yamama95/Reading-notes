**JavaScript Objects**

- *You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.*
- *JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.*
- *You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal*

**Object Properties**

The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called **properties**

**Object Methods**

*Objects can also have methods,Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.*

**Document Object Model (DOM)**

 (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a document such as the HTML representing a web page in memory.
 
 **With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:**
 - JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
